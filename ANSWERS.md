1. PropTypes are used to type check data that is being passed from component to another component. If not checked pro-actively, bugs can exist out where you are given a number when you are expecting the prop to be a string.

2. In the unmounting phase, the only function that exist is called componentWillUnmount which is the last method to be called right before the component is cleaned up and exits from the DOM

3. A Higher order component is a component that takes in other components as arguments and returns a new component source which hold logic that can be used to connect the two components that were passed.

4. Vanilla css/sass/scss is more customizable and can style whatever you need the way you want to.

Reactstrap/Material UI are libraries that have preset styles for carousels and buttons which lessens the time you need to actually make components. This is the fastest way to make stuff.

Styled Component is succinct, simple and a combination between javascript and css. It is declarative in nature. You have the ability to pass props which can be used as a means to conditionally render a component.
